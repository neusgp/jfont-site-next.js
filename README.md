## About

Joaquim and I first met back in 2014, when I was living in the sunny and beautiful Barcelona :sun_with_face:. He and another friend, Gabriel, were looking for a third flatmate and I ended up living with them in the Raval. The three of us were studying piano at the same university, so we developed a beautiful friendship that lasts until today. Even though my musical side is now resting and letting new things in, Joaquim is on fire in his endevours as a pianist and I decided to create a website for him.

## Tools

-   React / Next.js
-   Prisma  / PostgreSQL
-   Heroku / Vercel

## Things that I learned and worked on in the process

:seedling: This was my first time using Next.js and I really like it because its a super fast and easy way to build api rutes and, in my case, comunicate with the database.
:seedling: I discovered prisma, and I am really looking forward to keep learning about it in future projects. I love the fact that you can open and edit a db visualization on the browser (prisma studio).
:seedling: I got to know Vercel and learned a bit more about deploying full-stack applications in general.
